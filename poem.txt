Picture a wave. In the ocean. 
You can see it, 
measure it,
its height, 
the way the sunlight refracts when it passes through
And it's there
And you can see it, you know what it is

It's a wave

And then it crashes in the shore and it's gone
But the water is still there
The wave was just a different way for the water to be, 
for a little while
The wave returns to the ocean, where it came from and where it's supposed to be

The Good Place
